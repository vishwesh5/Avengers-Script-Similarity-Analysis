T'Challa: And the Border Tribe?

T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.

T'Challa: This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

T'Challa: On its way.

T'Challa: And what did you imagine?

T'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?

T'Challa: You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

T'Challa: We will hold them off.

T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.

T'Challa:  Thank you for standing with us.

T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

T'Challa: We open the barrier.  On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

T'Challa: On my signal.

T'Challa: WAKANDA FOREVER!  Now!

T'Challa:  How much longer, Shuri?

T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.

T'Challa: Fall back! Fall back now!

T'Challa:  Up, General. Up! This is no place to die.
