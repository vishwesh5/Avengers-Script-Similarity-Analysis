: This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman! We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing! Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.  Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here! This is not a warcraft, I repeat, this is not a warcraft!



Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...  for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.



Thanos:  I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless.  It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I am.



Thor:  You talk too much.

Thanos:  The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.



Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!



Loki:  ALL RIGHT, STOP!

Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.



Thor: You really are the worst brother.

Loki:  I assure you, brother, the sun will shine on us again.

Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

Loki: Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk.



Ebony Maw: Let him have his fun.



Heimdall:  Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.



Thanos: That was a mistake.



Thor: NO!!!  You're going to die for that!

Ebony Maw:  Shhh.

Ebony Maw:  My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.



Thanos: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

Proxima Midnight:  Father, we will not fail you.

Loki:  If I might interject… If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

Thanos: If you consider failure experience.

Loki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard...  Odinson... The rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.



Thanos: "Undying." You should choose your words more carefully.



Loki:  You will... never be... a god.

Thanos:  No resurrections this time.



Thor: No… Loki…







Doctor Strange:  Seriously? You don't have any money?

Wong:  Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

Doctor Strange: I'll tell the guys at the deli. Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

Wong: Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.

Doctor Strange: Dollars?

Wong: Rupees.

Doctor Strange: Which is?

Wong: Uh, buck and a half.

Doctor Strange: What do you want?

Wong: I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.



Bruce Banner: Thanos is coming. He's coming...

Doctor Strange:  ... Who?



Tony Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.

Pepper Potts:  You're totally rambling.

Tony Stark:  No, I'm not.

Pepper Potts: Lost me.

Tony Stark: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

Pepper Potts: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Okay, and then you're like, "Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?" "Oh! Someone's watching." "I'm gonna go in my pants."

Pepper Potts: Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.

Tony Stark: Yes.

Pepper Potts: Yeah. Everybody has that.

Tony Stark: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?

Pepper Potts:  Right.

Tony Stark: Morgan! Morgan.

Pepper Potts: So you woke up, and thought that we were...

Tony Stark: Expecting.

Pepper Potts: Yeah.

Tony Stark:  Yes?

Pepper Potts:  No.

Tony Stark: I had a dream about it. It was so real.

Pepper Potts: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.



Tony Stark: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.

Pepper Potts: It's not helping your case, OK?

Tony Stark: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-

Pepper Potts:  You don't need that.

Tony Stark: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...

Pepper Potts: Shirts?

Tony Stark: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.

Pepper Potts: You should have shirts in your closet.

Tony Stark: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.

Pepper Potts: Yes.

Tony Stark: I will.



Doctor Strange: Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?

Doctor Strange: We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.

Tony Stark: And who's "we"?

Bruce Banner:  Hey, Tony.

Tony Stark:  Bruce.

Bruce Banner: Pepper.

Pepper Potts: Hi.

Tony Stark: You okay?





Wong:  From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.

Doctor Strange: Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.



Tony Stark:  Tell me his name again.

Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York, that's him.

Tony Stark:  This is it. What's our timeline?

Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...

Doctor Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

Tony Stark:  Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

Doctor Strange: Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

Tony Stark: Is that what this is...?



Tony Stark:   I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?

Doctor Strange: No can do.

Wong: We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.

Tony Stark: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

Doctor Strange: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.

Tony Stark: It's not bad.

Doctor Strange: A bit chalky.

Wong: "A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge" is our favorite.

Bruce Banner: That's a thing?

Tony Stark: Whatever. Point is: Things change.

Doctor Strange: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

Tony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.

Doctor Strange: Well, if we don't do our jobs.

Tony Stark: What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?

Doctor Strange: Protecting your reality, douchebag.

Bruce Banner: Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.

Tony Stark:  Yeah, that's the... thing.

Bruce Banner: What do you mean?

Tony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.

Bruce Banner: What? Tony, you lost another super bot?

Tony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

Doctor Strange: Who could find Vision, then?

Tony Stark:  Shit.  Probably Steve Rogers.

Doctor Strange:  Oh, great.

Tony Stark: Maybe. But... sighs

Bruce Banner:  Call him.

Tony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

Bruce Banner: No.

Tony Stark: The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

Bruce Banner: Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?

Tony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.

Bruce Banner: Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.



Tony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?

Doctor Strange:  ... Not at the moment, no.



Tony Stark: You okay?



Tony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.

Bruce Banner: Go! Got it!

Tony Stark:  F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Not sure, I'm working on it.

Tony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

Doctor Strange: Might wanna use it.





Peter Parker:  Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

Ned Leeds:  Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!





Your Bus Driver, Stan Lee: What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?



Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Will do.





Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.

Ebony Maw:  Stonekeeper... Does this chattering animal speak for you?

Doctor Strange: Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet.

Tony Stark: It means get lost, Squidward!

Ebony Maw: He exhausts me.

Cull Obsidian:

Ebony Maw: Bring me the Stone.

Cull Obsidian:

Tony Stark: Banner, you want a piece?

Bruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?

Tony Stark: That's right.



Tony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.

Bruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.

Tony Stark: Where's your guy?

Bruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.

Tony Stark: There's no time for a thing.

Bruce Banner: I know.

Tony Stark:  That's the thing right there. Let's go.





Tony Stark:   Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

Bruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't-

Tony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

Wong: I have him.

Bruce Banner: Damn it.



Bruce Banner: Where'd that come from?

Tony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-



Doctor Strange: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...



Tony Stark: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

Doctor Strange: It stays with me.

Tony Stark: Exactly. Bye.



Bruce Banner:  Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?

Tony Stark: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

Bruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.



Tony Stark: Hammer.



Bruce Banner:   Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me?  Come out! Come out! Come out!

Hulk: Nooooooo!

Bruce Banner: What do you mean, "no"?!



Peter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

Tony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?

Peter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.



Peter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

Tony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.





Ebony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.



Doctor Strange: It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

Ebony Maw: Then I'll take it off your corpse.



Doctor Strange: You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.

Ebony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead.  NO!

Tony Stark:  Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

Peter Parker: On it!



Peter Parker:  Not cool!



Peter Parker: Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!

Tony Stark: Hang on, kid.

Wong, you're invited to my wedding.  Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y.



Tony Stark:  Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

Peter Parker: But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!

Tony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.

Peter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.



Peter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

Tony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Yep.



Peter Parker: Oh, come on!



F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

Pepper Potts: Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?

Tony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.

Pepper Potts: Why?

Tony Stark:  Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.

Pepper Potts: Tell me you're not on that ship.

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Pepper Potts: God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.

Tony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

Pepper Potts: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…

Tony Stark: Pep…

Pepper Potts: Come back here right now! Come back!

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too…



Peter Parker: Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus.







Bruce Banner: Where you going?

Wong: The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?

Bruce Banner:  I'm gonna make a call.







Peter Quill:  Sing it, Drax!





Rocket:  Why are we doing this again?

Gamora:  It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.

Rocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?

Peter Quill: 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.

Gamora:  Which isn't the point.

Peter Quill:  Which isn't the point... I mean… If he doesn't pony up…

Drax: We'll take his ship.

Rocket: Exactly!

Peter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!





Mantis:  We are arriving.

Peter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again.



Peter Quill: Groot.

Groot:  I am Groot!

Peter Quill: Whoa!

Rocket: Language!

Gamora: Hey!

Drax: Wow.

Peter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.

Rocket: Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!





Mantis: What happened?

Rocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.



Rocket:  Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!





Peter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?

Drax:: He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man.

Peter Quill: I'm muscular.

Rocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.

Peter Quill: Yeah, right.

Drax: It's true. You have gained a little weight…



Peter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm…

Mantis: He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

Drax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

Peter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

Gamora:  It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

Peter Quill:  Stop massaging his muscles.   Wake him up.

Mantis: Wake.



Thor: Who the hell are you guys?



Gamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre...

Drax: Including my own.

Gamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this.

Thor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

Drax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.

Thor: Your father killed my brother.

Peter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do.

Thor: Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.



Peter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-"

Thor:  I need a hammer, not a spoon…  How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… Maybe a birth date or something…

Peter Quill: What are you doing?

Thor: Taking your pod.

Peter Quill:  No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.

Rocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

Peter Quill: No.

Drax: You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

Peter Quill: No I'm not.

Mantis:  He just did it again!

Peter Quill: This is my voice!

Thor:  Are you mocking me?

Peter Quill: Are you mocking me?

Thor: Stop it. You did it again.

Peter Quill: He's trying to copy me.

Thor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.

Gamora: Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.

Thor: Knowhere.

Mantis: He must be going somewhere.

Peter Quill: No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food.

Thor: Not anymore.

Gamora: Thor… Why would he go to Knowhere?

Thor: Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.

Peter Quill: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

Thor: Or a genius.

Gamora:  How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?

Thor: There's six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.

Peter Quill: The Avengers?

Thor: They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

Mantis: Like Kevin Bacon?

Thor: ...He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.

Gamora: Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

Thor: Wrong. Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.

Drax: That's a made up word.

Thor: All words are made up.

Rocket: Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.

Thor: The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.

Rocket: Rabbit?

Thor: Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?

Rocket: You're very perceptive.

Thor: You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

Rocket: Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

Thor: Wonderful.

Peter Quill: Except for that I'm the captain.

Thor: Quiet!

Peter Quill: That's my backpack.

Rocket: Go sit down.

Peter Quill:  Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?

Thor: The Thanos killing kind.

Peter Quill: Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

Thor: No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.

Rocket: Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

Thor: A little bit. Yeah.

Gamora: If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.

Thor: He already is.

Rocket: I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.

Thor: So cool.

Peter Quill:  For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.

Rocket: You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.

Thor: I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.





Vision:

Wanda Maximoff: Vis? Is it the stone again?

Vision: It's as if it's speaking to me.

Wanda Maximoff: What does it say?

Vision: I don't... I don't know. But something...



Vision: Tell me what you feel.



Wanda Maximoff: I just feel you.



Wanda Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.

Vision: What if I miss that train?

Wanda Maximoff: There is an 11.

Vision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?

Wanda Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.

Vision: I'd rather give it to you.

Wanda Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.

Vision: Not to each other.  Wanda… For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. - I, I... I think...

Wanda Maximoff: It works.

Vision: It works.

Vision: Then stay. Stay with me.



Vision:  Or not. If I'm overstepping…



Wanda Maximoff:  What are they?

Vision: What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.

Wanda Maximoff: No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… Then maybe going isn't the best idea.

Vision: Wanda, I…

Wanda Maximoff: Vision!





Vision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.

Wanda Maximoff: Is that even possible?

Vision: It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.



Wanda Maximoff: Vis!



Corvus Glaive:  Give up the Stone, and she lives.









Wanda Maximoff: Hands off.



Wanda Maximoff: Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.

Vision: Please. Please leave.

Wanda Maximoff: You asked me to stay... I'm staying.

Vision: Please.

Wanda Maximoff: Get up.





as he steps into the light. Vision and Wanda look hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson  swoops in and kicks Proxima across the platform and through the closed café's security gate and furniture. Swooping around, he fires on Corvus.]

who engages Corvus, ducking under his swing, stabbing him in the gut and executing a flying kick to knock him backwards.]



Proxima Midnight:  Get up.

Corvus Glaive: I can't.

Natasha Romanoff:  We don't wanna kill you. But we will.

Proxima Midnight: You'll never get the chance again.



Sam Wilson:  Can you stand?

Vision:  Thank you, Captain.

Steve Rogers:  Let's get you on the jet.

Natasha Romanoff:  I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.

Wanda Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

Sam Wilson: Where to, Cap?

Steve Rogers: Home.



Gamora's Mother:  Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.



Child of Thanos:





Ebony Maw:  Zehobereians…

Young Gamora:  Mother! Where's my mother?!

Ebony Maw: Choose a side, or die.

Young Gamora: Mother!

Ebony Maw: One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.



Thanos: What's wrong, little one?

Young Gamora: My mother. Where is my mother?

Thanos:  What's your name?

Young Gamora: Gamora.

Thanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Here. You try.



Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.



Thanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.



Peter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-

Gamora: I need to ask a favor.

Peter Quill: Yeah, sure.

Gamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

Peter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?

Gamora: If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.

Peter Quill:  What?

Gamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… The entire Universe could be at risk.

Peter Quill:  What do you know?

Gamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.

Peter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?

Gamora: Only if you wanna die.

Peter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

Gamora: Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.

Peter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would…

Gamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.

Peter Quill:  Okay.



Peter Quill: Dude! How long have you been standing there?

Drax: An hour.

Peter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?

Drax: I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye. Watch.



Peter Quill: You're eating a zarg-nut.

Drax: But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.

Peter Quill: Mmm, no.

Drax: I'm sure I'm invisible.

Mantis: Hi, Drax.

Drax: Damn it.



Peter Quill: This place looks deserted.

Drax: I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.

Peter Quill: Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.



Collector: I don't have it.

Thanos: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.



Thanos: I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

Collector:  I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?

Thanos: I imagine it's like breathing for you.

Collector: Like suicide.

Thanos: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.

Collector: I didn't know what it was.

Thanos: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?

Drax: Today...

Peter Quill: Drax. Drax.

Drax: ...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

Peter Quill: Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.

Drax: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.



Mantis: Sleeeep.



Peter Quill: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!



Thanos: Why?  Why you? Daughter…

Peter Quill:  That was quick.

Collector: Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!



Thanos: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.



Thanos: That is, it was. Now… Reality can be whatever I want.



Gamora:  You knew I'd come.

Thanos: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.



Drax: Thanos!



Peter Quill: Let her go, Grimace!

Gamora: Peter…

Peter Quill:  I told you to go right.

Gamora: Now? Really?

Peter Quill: You let her go!

Thanos: Ah, the boyfriend.

Peter Quill: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.

Gamora: Peter…

Peter Quill: Or I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face!

Gamora: Not him.



Gamora: You promised! You promised.

Thanos: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it.  Do it!

Peter Quill:  I told you to go right.

Gamora: I love you, more than anything.

Peter Quill: I love you, too.



Thanos: I like you.



.)

Secretary Ross: Still no word from Vision?

James Rhodes: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

Secretary Ross: On a stolen quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

James Rhodes: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

Secretary Ross: My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

James Rhodes: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.

Secretary Ross: I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

James Rhodes: That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.

Secretary Ross: You have second thoughts?

James Rhodes: Not anymore.



Steve Rogers: Mr. Secretary.

Secretary Ross: You got some nerve. I'll give you that.

Natasha Romanoff: You could use some of that right now.

Secretary Ross: The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?

Steve Rogers: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.

Secretary Ross:  Arrest them.

James Rhodes: All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.

Steve Rogers:  You too, Rhodey.

James Rhodes: Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.

Sam Wilson: Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

Bruce Banner: Uh, I think you look great. Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.

Natasha Romanoff: Hi, Bruce.

Bruce Banner: Nat.

Sam Wilson:  This is awkward.



James Rhodes: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

Wanda Maximoff: And they can clearly find us.

Bruce Banner: We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

Natasha Romanoff: After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.

Bruce Banner: Who's Scott?

Steve Rogers: Ant-Man.

Bruce Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's stone.

Natasha Romanoff: Well then, we have to protect it.

Vision: No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… Its molecular integrity could fail.

Wanda Maximoff: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.

Vision: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

Wanda Maximoff: That's too high a price.

Vision:  Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

Steve Rogers: But it should. We don't trade lives, Vision.

Vision:  Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?



Bruce Banner: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.

Wanda Maximoff: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

Bruce Banner: I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.

Natasha Romanoff: Can we do that?

Bruce Banner: Not me. Not here.

James Rhodes: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.

Steve Rogers: I know somewhere.



Okoye: You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

T'Challa: And the Border Tribe?

Okoye: Those that are left.

T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.

Okoye: And what of this one?

T'Challa: This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.



Bucky Barnes:  Where's the fight?

T'Challa: On its way.



Ebony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. [the needles start to contact Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch[ Give me... the stone.



Tony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

Peter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...



Tony Stark: What the-

Peter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.

Tony Stark: You should not be here.



Peter Parker: I was gonna go home-

Tony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.

Peter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-

Tony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.



Peter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.



Tony Stark:  What did you just say?

Peter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.

Tony Stark: Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.

Peter Parker: No. I did think this through.

Tony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.

Peter Parker: It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.

Tony Stark:  Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.

Peter Parker: Um. Okay, okay...uh....  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?





Ebony Maw: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...



Ebony Maw: ...could end your friend's life in an instant.

Tony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.

Ebony Maw:  You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

Tony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.



Peter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those!



Peter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.



Doctor Strange: We've gotta turn this ship around.

Tony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.

Doctor Strange: No, I want to protect the stone.



Tony Stark:  And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.

Doctor Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

Tony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

Doctor Strange: I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

Tony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.

Doctor Strange: Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

Tony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.

Peter Parker:  I'm backup.

Tony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.

Doctor Strange: I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. What is he, your ward?

Peter Parker: No. I'm Peter, by the way.

Doctor Strange: Doctor Strange.

Peter Parker: Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.

Tony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.

Doctor Strange:  Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?

Tony Stark: Yeah?

Doctor Strange: Can you get us home?

Tony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.

Doctor Strange: Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.

Tony Stark:  No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?

Doctor Strange:  Alright , Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.

Tony Stark: Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.





Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.



Gamora: I always hated that chair.

Thanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.

Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.

Thanos: You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.

Gamora: I was a child when you took me.

Thanos: I saved you.

Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.

Thanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.

Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.

Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.

Gamora: You're insane.

Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.

Gamora: You don't know that!

Thanos: I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.

Gamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

Thanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

Gamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.

Thanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did. And you lied.



Gamora: Nebula.



Gamora: Don't do this.

Thanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

Gamora: Please don't do this.

Thanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.



Gamora: Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.



Memory Nebula: You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.

Memory Gamora: He can never get them all.

Memory Nebula: He will!

Memory Gamora: He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.



Thanos:  You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone?

Gamora: Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.

Thanos: Show me.



Groot:  I am Groot.

Rocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.

Groot:  I am Groot.

Thor:  Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.

Rocket: You speak Groot?

Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

Groot:  I am Groot.

Thor: You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.



Rocket: Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.

Thor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.

Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?

Thor: Both dead.

Rocket: Still got a mom, though?

Thor: Killed by a dark elf.

Rocket: A best friend?

Thor: Stabbed through the heart.

Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

Thor:  Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.

Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about...He's the toughest there is.

Thor: Well, he's never fought me.

Rocket: Yeah, he has.

Thor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

Rocket: Better be some hammer.

Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

Rocket: And what if you're wrong?

Thor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?



Rocket:  I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

Thor: What's this?

Rocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.

Thor: He gave you his eye?

Rocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.

Thor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.



Rocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...Hey, we're here!

Thor:  I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.

Rocket: It ain't the eye.



Thor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.





Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

Thor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...

Rocket:  You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

Thor: Yes. Why?

Rocket: Look anything like that?

Groot:  I am Groot.

Thor:  Go back to the pod.



Thor: Eitri, wait! Stop!

Eitri: Thor?

Thor: What happened here?

Eitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!

Thor: Asgard is destroyed.   Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

Eitri:  300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. "Your life is yours." he said "But your hands are mine alone."

Thor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer, sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.



Nebula: Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.



Peter Parker:  Hey, what's going on?

Doctor Strange: I think we're here.

Tony Stark: I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?

Peter Parker: Yep, got it.

Tony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.

Peter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.



Peter Parker: We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!







Tony Stark:  You alright?   That was close. I owe you one.



Peter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I end up eating you, I'm sorry.

Tony Stark:  I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

Peter Parker: I'm trying to say that something is coming.





Drax:  Thanos!





Peter Parker:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!



Peter Quill: Stay down, clown.



Drax:  Die, blanket of death!







Peter Quill: Everybody stay where you are. Chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?

Tony Stark:  Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

Drax: I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?

Peter Quill:  Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

Tony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!

Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.

Mantis: No he can't take it!

Doctor Strange:  She's right. You can't.

Peter Quill: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.

Doctor Strange: Wait, what, Thanos?  All right, let me ask you this one time. What master do you serve?

Peter Quill: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? "Jesus"?

Tony Stark: You're from Earth?

Peter Quill: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

Tony Stark: Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?

Peter Parker:  So, you're not with Thanos?

Peter Quill:  With Thanos? No, I'm here to kill Thanos. He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

Peter Parker: We're the Avengers, man.

Peter Quill: Oh.

Mantis: You're the ones Thor told us about.

Tony Stark: You know Thor?

Peter Quill: Yeah. Tall guy, not the good-looking, needed saving.

Doctor Strange: Where is he now?



Rocket: This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

Eitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

Thor: Did it have a name?

Eitri: Stormbreaker.

Rocket: That's a bit much.

Thor: So how do we make it?

Eitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.

Thor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.



Peter Quill: The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.



Tony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.



Tony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?

Drax: I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

Tony Stark:  Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

Peter Quill: See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

Peter Parker: Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

Mantis:  Kick names, take ass.

Drax: Yeah, that's right

Tony Stark:  Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

Peter Quill: "Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

Tony Stark: We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....

Peter Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good.

Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

Tony Stark: What dance-off?

Peter Quill: It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.

Peter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?

Peter Quill:  Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?

Peter Parker: It never was.



Tony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?

Peter Parker: Okay.

Tony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.

Peter Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.

Tony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.

Mantis: Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?



Tony Stark: Strange, we alright?



Tony Stark: You're back. You're alright.

Peter Parker: Hey, what was that?

Doctor Strange:  I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

Peter Quill: How many did you see?

Doctor Strange: 14,000,605.

Tony Stark: How many did we win?



Doctor Strange: One.



Thanos: The stone had better be up there...For your sister's sake.



Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

Thanos: You know us?

Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.

Thanos: Where's the Soul Stone?

Stonekeeper: You should know... it extracts a terrible price.

Thanos: I am prepared.

Stonekeeper: We all think that at first.  We are all wrong.



Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?

Red Skull: A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.



Red Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.

Thanos: What's this?

Red Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.

Thanos: Tell me what it needs.

Red Skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.

Thanos: Of what?

Red Skull: In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.



Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.

Thanos:

Gamora: Really? Tears?

Red Skull: They're not for him.



Gamora: No. This isn't love.

Thanos: I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.   I'm sorry, little one.

Gamora:  No!







Steve Rogers:  Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

Sam Wilson: I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.





Okoye:  When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world...This is not what I imagined.

T'Challa: And what did you imagine?

Okoye: The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.



Bruce Banner:  Should we bow?

James Rhodes:  Yeah, he's a king.

Steve Rogers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.



James Rhodes:  What are you doing?

T'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?



Bruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.

Natasha Romanoff: How we looking?

T'Challa: You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

Bucky Barnes:  A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.



Steve Rogers: How you been, Buck?

Bucky Barnes: Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.



Shuri: Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.

Bruce Banner: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

Shuri: Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?

Bruce Banner:  Because, we didn't think of it.

Shuri:  I'm sure you did your best.

Wanda Maximoff: Can you do it?

Shuri: Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.  It will take time, brother.

Steve Rogers: How long?

Shuri: As long as you can give me.

Okoye:  Something's entered the atmosphere.



Sam Wilson:  Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.



Bucky Barnes: God, I love this place.

James Rhodes:  Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.



Vision:  It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.

Natasha Romanoff:  Vision, get your ass back on the table.

T'Challa: We will hold them off.

Steve Rogers:  Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.

Wanda Maximoff: I will.

T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.

jumps from the hull onto the ring surface with a cable in his hand attached to the pod]

Rocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

Thor: Leave that to me.

Rocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-

Fire the engines!

Rocket:  Nnnyah!

Thor:  More... power... rabbit!



Eitri: Well done, boy.



Thor: That's Nivadellir!



Eitri: Damn it.

Rocket: "Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.

Thor: What?

Eitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.

Thor: How long will it take to heat?

Eitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

Thor:  I'm gonna hold it open.

Eitri: That's suicide.

Thor: So is facing Thanos without that axe.



Natasha Romanoff: How we looking, Bruce?

Bruce Banner:  Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-  I'm okay. I'm okay.

James Rhodes: I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.





Jabari Warriors: MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU!

T'Challa:  Thank you for standing with us.

M'Baku:  Of course, brother.



Natasha Romanoff: Where's your other friend?

Proxima Midnight: You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.

Steve Rogers: That's not gonna happen.

T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

Proxima Midnight: We... have blood to spare.



Bucky Barnes:  Did they surrender?

Steve Rogers: Not exactly.



Bucky Barnes:  What the hell.

Natasha Romanoff: Looks like we pissed her off.

Okoye:  They're killing themselves.



Sam Wilson:  You seen the teeth on those things?

James Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed.



Bruce Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision.

Steve Rogers:  Them we better keep 'em in front of us.

Okoye:  How do we do that?

T'Challa: We open the barrier.  On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

Dome Control: Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?

T'Challa: On my signal.

M'Baku:  This will be the end of Wakanda.

Okoye: Then it will be the noblest ending in history.



T'Challa: WAKANDA FOREVER!  Now!



T'Challa:  How much longer, Shuri?

Shuri: We've barely begun, brother.

T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.



Thor: Allfathers, give me strength.

Eitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.

Thor: Only if I die.

Eitri:  Yes. That's what... "killing you" means.



Eitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!



Rocket:  Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay?



Rocket: I think he's dying!

Eitri: He needs the axe! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!

Stormbreaker's two sections - the hammer and the axeblade - lay glowing on the floor. Groot looks sadly at Thor, then scowls with determination. He stands, and extends his fingers towards Stormbreaker, growing them at extraordinary speed. As he twines them around the two parts, he cries out at the burning pain but does not hesitate, slamming them together and locking them permanently into one structure. He raises it above his head, and with a mighty cry, chops his extended arm with his other hand to sever it at the right length.]





Bruce Banner: There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!



Bruce Banner:  AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!

Thor: BRING ME THANOS!!!



Doctor Strange:  Oh, yeah. You're much more of a Thanos.

Thanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.

Doctor Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

Thanos: And where do you think he brought you?

Doctor Strange: Let me guess. Your home?

Thanos:  It was.  And it was beautiful.  Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

Doctor Strange: Genocide.

Thanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass.

Doctor Strange:  Congratulations. You're a prophet.

Thanos: I'm a survivor.

Doctor Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.

Thanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that...mercy.

Doctor Strange:  And then what?

Thanos: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

Doctor Strange:  I think... you'll find... our wil...l equal to yours.

Thanos: Our?



Tony Stark:  Piece of cake, Quill.

Peter Quill:  Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.









Peter Quill: Boom!



Doctor Strange:  Do not let him close his fist.



Peter Parker: Magic!  More magic!  Magic with a kick!  Magic with a-



Thanos: Insect!







Thanos: Well, well.

Nebula: You should have killed me.

Thanos: It would've been a waste of parts!

Nebula:  Where's Gamora?!













Tony Stark:  Is he under? Don't let up.

Mantis:  Be quick. He is very strong.

Tony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here.  She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

Peter Quill:  I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?

Thanos: My... Gamora...?

Peter Quill: No, bullshit. Where is she?

Mantis:  He is in anguish!

Peter Quill: Good.

Mantis:  He… he… mourns!

Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?!

Nebula: Gamora.

Peter Quill: ...What?

Nebula: He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.

Tony Stark:  Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?



Tony Stark: Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!

Peter Quill: Tell me she's lying.  ASSHOLE! TELL ME YOU DIDN'T DO IT!!!

Thanos: I... had... to.

Peter Quill:   No, you didn't… No, you didn't…   NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!

Drax: Quill!



Tony Stark:  Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

Peter Parker: It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!  I got it! I got it...!



Peter Parker:  Oh, God.









Rocket:  Come and get some, space dogs!  Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some!  How much for the gun?

Bucky Barnes:  Not for sale.

Rocket: How much for the arm?  Oh, I'll get that arm.



Steve Rogers:  New haircut?

Thor:  Notice you've copied my beard.



Thor: By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

Groot:  I am GROOT!

Steve Rogers:  I am Steve Rogers.



T'Challa: Fall back! Fall back now!



James Rhodes: Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

Sam Wilson: I'm doing it.



Okoye:  Why was she up there all this time?



Proxima Midnight: She's on the field. Take it.





Sam Wilson: Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

Steve Rogers: Somebody get to Vision!

Bruce Banner: I got him!

Wanda Maximoff: On my way.

Proxima Midnight:  He'll die alone. As will you.

Natasha Romanoff: She's not alone.



Proxima Midnight: Euuyaaah!



Bruce Banner: Ohh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-

Bruce Banner: Guys! Vision needs backup now!   Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.  Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

Hulk: NOOOO!

Bruce Banner: Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!  Come on!



Bruce Banner: See ya!  Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.





Corvus Glaive: I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man.

Steve Rogers: Get outta here!  Go!



Natasha Romanoff: That was really gross.



Steve Rogers:  I thought I told you to go.

Vision: We don't trade lives, Captain.



Peter Parker:  I got you! I got you!  I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names!







Thanos: You're full of tricks, wizard.

Doctor Strange:  No!

Thanos:  Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.  A fake.



Tony Stark: You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

Thanos: Stark.

Tony Stark: You know me?

Thanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

Tony Stark: My only curse is you.

Thanos: Come on!







Thanos:   All that for a drop of blood.





Thanos: You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.  I hope they remember you.





Doctor Strange: Stop!  Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.

Thanos: No tricks.

Tony Stark: Don't..!



Thanos: One to go.

Peter Quill:



Peter Quill:  Where is he?!



Peter Quill:  Did we just lose?

Tony Stark:  Why would you do that?

Doctor Strange: We're in the endgame now.



M'Baku: MAYEFA!

Jabari: YA HU!



Wanda Maximoff:  Are you okay?  What? What is it?

Vision: He's here.



Steve Rogers: Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

Natasha Romanoff: What the hell?

Bruce Banner:  Cap. That's him.

Steve Rogers: Eyes up. Stay sharp.









Vision: Wanda. It's time.

Wanda Maximoff: No.

Vision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.

Wanda Maximoff: Don't.

Vision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We are out of time.

Wanda Maximoff: I can't.

Vision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

Wanda Maximoff: It's not fair.

Vision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just feel you.

















Vision:  It's all right. It's all right. I love you.



Thanos:  I understand, my child. Better than anyone.

Wanda Maximoff:  You could never.

Thanos:  Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now is no time at all.

Wanda Maximoff: NO!







Thor:  I told you. You'd die for that!



Thanos:  You should've... You....  You should've gone for the head.

Thor: NO!



Thanos: Daughter?

Gamora: Did you do it?

Thanos: Yes.

Gamora:  What did it cost?

Thanos:  ... Everything.



Thor: What'd you do?  WHAT'D YOU DO?!



Steve Rogers:  Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?

Bucky Barnes:  Steve?





T'Challa:  Up, General. Up! This is no place to die.

Okoye: Kumkani...?!

Groot:  I am Groot...

Rocket:  No.... No. No. No. No! Groot... no.



James Rhodes:  Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!



Mantis: Something... is... happening.

Drax:  Quill...?

Tony Stark: Steady, Quill.

Peter Quill: Aw, man.

Doctor Strange:  Tony, there was no other way.

Peter Parker:  Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...

Tony Stark:  You're all right.

Peter Parker:  I don't know what's- I don't know what's happening. I don't-  Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry.

Nebula:  He did it.





James Rhodes: What is this? What the hell is happening?

Steve Rogers: .... Oh, God.



Nick Fury: Still no word from Stark?

Maria Hill: No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing.

Nick Fury: What is it?

Maria Hill: Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

Nick Fury: Same energy signatures as New York?

Maria Hill: Ten times bigger.

Nick Fury: Tell Klein we'll meet him at-

Maria Hill: Nick! NICK!

Nick Fury: They okay?



Maria Hill: There's no one here.



Nick Fury: Call Control. Code Red!

Maria Hill:  Nick...?



Nick Fury: Hill?



Nick Fury: Oh, no. Motherf-
