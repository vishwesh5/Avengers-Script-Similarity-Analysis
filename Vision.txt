Vision:

Vision: It's as if it's speaking to me.

Vision: I don't... I don't know. But something...

Vision: Tell me what you feel.

Vision: What if I miss that train?

Vision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?

Vision: I'd rather give it to you.

Vision: Not to each other.  Wanda… For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. - I, I... I think...

Vision: It works.

Vision: Then stay. Stay with me.

Vision:  Or not. If I'm overstepping…

Vision: What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.

Vision: Wanda, I…

Vision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.

Vision: It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.

Vision: Please. Please leave.

Vision: Please.

Vision:  Thank you, Captain.

Vision: No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… Its molecular integrity could fail.

Vision: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

Vision:  Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

Vision:  Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?

Vision:  It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.

Vision: We don't trade lives, Captain.

Vision: He's here.

Vision: Wanda. It's time.

Vision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.

Vision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We are out of time.

Vision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

Vision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just feel you.

Vision:  It's all right. It's all right. I love you.
