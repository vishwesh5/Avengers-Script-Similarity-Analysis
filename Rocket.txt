Rocket:  Why are we doing this again?

Rocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?

Rocket: Exactly!

Rocket: Language!

Rocket: Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!

Rocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.

Rocket:  Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!

Rocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.

Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

Rocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

Rocket: Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.

Rocket: Rabbit?

Rocket: You're very perceptive.

Rocket: Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

Rocket: Go sit down.

Rocket: Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

Rocket: I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.

Rocket: You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.

Rocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.

Rocket: You speak Groot?

Rocket: Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.

Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?

Rocket: Still got a mom, though?

Rocket: A best friend?

Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about...He's the toughest there is.

Rocket: Yeah, he has.

Rocket: Better be some hammer.

Rocket: And what if you're wrong?

Rocket:  I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

Rocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.

Rocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.

Rocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...Hey, we're here!

Rocket: It ain't the eye.

Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

Rocket:  You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

Rocket: Look anything like that?

Rocket: This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

Rocket: That's a bit much.

Rocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

Rocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-

Rocket:  Nnnyah!

Rocket: "Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

Rocket:  Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay?

Rocket: I think he's dying!

Rocket:  Come and get some, space dogs!  Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some!  How much for the gun?

Rocket: How much for the arm?  Oh, I'll get that arm.

Rocket:  No.... No. No. No. No! Groot... no.
