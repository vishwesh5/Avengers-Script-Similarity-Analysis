Steve Rogers:  Let's get you on the jet.

Steve Rogers: Home.

Steve Rogers: Mr. Secretary.

Steve Rogers: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.

Steve Rogers:  You too, Rhodey.

Steve Rogers: Ant-Man.

Steve Rogers: But it should. We don't trade lives, Vision.

Steve Rogers: I know somewhere.

Steve Rogers:  Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

Steve Rogers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

Steve Rogers: How you been, Buck?

Steve Rogers: How long?

Steve Rogers:  Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.

Steve Rogers: That's not gonna happen.

Steve Rogers: Not exactly.

Steve Rogers:  Them we better keep 'em in front of us.

Steve Rogers:  New haircut?

Steve Rogers:  I am Steve Rogers.

Steve Rogers: Somebody get to Vision!

Steve Rogers: Get outta here!  Go!

Steve Rogers:  I thought I told you to go.

Steve Rogers: Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

Steve Rogers: Eyes up. Stay sharp.

Steve Rogers:  Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?

Steve Rogers: .... Oh, God.
