James Rhodes: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

James Rhodes: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

James Rhodes: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.

James Rhodes: That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.

James Rhodes: Not anymore.

James Rhodes: All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.

James Rhodes: Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.

James Rhodes: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

James Rhodes: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.

James Rhodes:  Yeah, he's a king.

James Rhodes:  What are you doing?

James Rhodes:  Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.

James Rhodes: I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.

James Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed.

James Rhodes: Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

James Rhodes:  Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!

James Rhodes: What is this? What the hell is happening?
