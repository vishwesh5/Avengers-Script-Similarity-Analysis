Wanda Maximoff: Vis? Is it the stone again?

Wanda Maximoff: What does it say?

Wanda Maximoff: I just feel you.

Wanda Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.

Wanda Maximoff: There is an 11.

Wanda Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.

Wanda Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.

Wanda Maximoff: It works.

Wanda Maximoff:  What are they?

Wanda Maximoff: No, Vision. Vision, if that's trueâ€¦ Then maybe going isn't the best idea.

Wanda Maximoff: Vision!

Wanda Maximoff: Is that even possible?

Wanda Maximoff: Vis!

Wanda Maximoff: Hands off.

Wanda Maximoff: Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.

Wanda Maximoff: You asked me to stay... I'm staying.

Wanda Maximoff: Get up.

Wanda Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

Wanda Maximoff: And they can clearly find us.

Wanda Maximoff: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.

Wanda Maximoff: That's too high a price.

Wanda Maximoff: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

Wanda Maximoff: Can you do it?

Wanda Maximoff: I will.

Wanda Maximoff: On my way.

Wanda Maximoff:  Are you okay?  What? What is it?

Wanda Maximoff: No.

Wanda Maximoff: Don't.

Wanda Maximoff: I can't.

Wanda Maximoff: It's not fair.

Wanda Maximoff:  You could never.

Wanda Maximoff: NO!
