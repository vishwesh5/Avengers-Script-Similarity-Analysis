Tony Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.

Tony Stark:  No, I'm not.

Tony Stark: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

Tony Stark: Okay, and then you're like, "Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?" "Oh! Someone's watching." "I'm gonna go in my pants."

Tony Stark: Yes.

Tony Stark: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?

Tony Stark: Morgan! Morgan.

Tony Stark: Expecting.

Tony Stark:  Yes?

Tony Stark: I had a dream about it. It was so real.

Tony Stark: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.

Tony Stark: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-

Tony Stark: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...

Tony Stark: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.

Tony Stark: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.

Tony Stark: I will.

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?

Tony Stark: And who's "we"?

Tony Stark:  Bruce.

Tony Stark: You okay?

Tony Stark:  Tell me his name again.

Tony Stark:  This is it. What's our timeline?

Tony Stark:  Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

Tony Stark: Is that what this is...?

Tony Stark:   I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?

Tony Stark: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

Tony Stark: It's not bad.

Tony Stark: Whatever. Point is: Things change.

Tony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.

Tony Stark: What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?

Tony Stark:  Yeah, that's the... thing.

Tony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.

Tony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

Tony Stark:  Shit.  Probably Steve Rogers.

Tony Stark: Maybe. But... sighs

Tony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

Tony Stark: The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

Tony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.

Tony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?

Tony Stark: You okay?

Tony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.

Tony Stark:  F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?

Tony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.

Tony Stark: It means get lost, Squidward!

Tony Stark: Banner, you want a piece?

Tony Stark: That's right.

Tony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.

Tony Stark: Where's your guy?

Tony Stark: There's no time for a thing.

Tony Stark:  That's the thing right there. Let's go.

Tony Stark:   Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

Tony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

Tony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-

Tony Stark: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

Tony Stark: Exactly. Bye.

Tony Stark: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

Tony Stark: Hammer.

Tony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?

Tony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

Tony Stark:  Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

Tony Stark: Hang on, kid.

Tony Stark:  Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

Tony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.

Tony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.

Tony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.

Tony Stark:  Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

Tony Stark: Pepâ€¦

Tony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

Tony Stark: What the-

Tony Stark: You should not be here.

Tony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.

Tony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.

Tony Stark:  What did you just say?

Tony Stark: Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.

Tony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.

Tony Stark:  Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.

Tony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.

Tony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

Tony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.

Tony Stark:  And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.

Tony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

Tony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.

Tony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.

Tony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.

Tony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.

Tony Stark: Yeah?

Tony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.

Tony Stark:  No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?

Tony Stark: Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.

Tony Stark: I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?

Tony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.

Tony Stark:  You alright?   That was close. I owe you one.

Tony Stark:  I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

Tony Stark:  Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

Tony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!

Tony Stark: You're from Earth?

Tony Stark: Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?

Tony Stark: You know Thor?

Tony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.

Tony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?

Tony Stark:  Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

Tony Stark:  Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

Tony Stark: We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....

Tony Stark: What dance-off?

Tony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?

Tony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.

Tony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.

Tony Stark: Strange, we alright?

Tony Stark: You're back. You're alright.

Tony Stark: How many did we win?

Tony Stark:  Piece of cake, Quill.

Tony Stark:  Is he under? Don't let up.

Tony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here.  She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

Tony Stark:  Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?

Tony Stark: Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!

Tony Stark:  Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

Tony Stark: You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

Tony Stark: You know me?

Tony Stark: My only curse is you.

Tony Stark: Don't..!

Tony Stark:  Why would you do that?

Tony Stark: Steady, Quill.

Tony Stark:  You're all right.
