Gamora:  It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.

Gamora:  Which isn't the point.

Gamora: Hey!

Gamora:  It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

Gamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre...

Gamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this.

Gamora: Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.

Gamora: Thor… Why would he go to Knowhere?

Gamora:  How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?

Gamora: Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

Gamora: If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.

Gamora: I need to ask a favor.

Gamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

Gamora: If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.

Gamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… The entire Universe could be at risk.

Gamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.

Gamora: Only if you wanna die.

Gamora: Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.

Gamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.

Gamora:  You knew I'd come.

Gamora: Peter…

Gamora: Now? Really?

Gamora: Peter…

Gamora: Not him.

Gamora: You promised! You promised.

Gamora: I love you, more than anything.

Gamora: I always hated that chair.

Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.

Gamora: I was a child when you took me.

Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.

Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.

Gamora: You're insane.

Gamora: You don't know that!

Gamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

Gamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.

Gamora: Nebula.

Gamora: Don't do this.

Gamora: Please don't do this.

Gamora: Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.

Gamora: Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.

Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.

Gamora: Really? Tears?

Gamora: No. This isn't love.

Gamora:  No!

Gamora: Did you do it?

Gamora:  What did it cost?
