Peter Quill:  Sing it, Drax!

Peter Quill: 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.

Peter Quill:  Which isn't the point... I mean… If he doesn't pony up…

Peter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!

Peter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again.

Peter Quill: Groot.

Peter Quill: Whoa!

Peter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.

Peter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?

Peter Quill: I'm muscular.

Peter Quill: Yeah, right.

Peter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm…

Peter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

Peter Quill:  Stop massaging his muscles.   Wake him up.

Peter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do.

Peter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-"

Peter Quill: What are you doing?

Peter Quill:  No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.

Peter Quill: No.

Peter Quill: No I'm not.

Peter Quill: This is my voice!

Peter Quill: Are you mocking me?

Peter Quill: He's trying to copy me.

Peter Quill: No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food.

Peter Quill: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

Peter Quill: The Avengers?

Peter Quill: Except for that I'm the captain.

Peter Quill: That's my backpack.

Peter Quill:  Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?

Peter Quill: Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

Peter Quill:  For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.

Peter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-

Peter Quill: Yeah, sure.

Peter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?

Peter Quill:  What?

Peter Quill:  What do you know?

Peter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?

Peter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

Peter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would…

Peter Quill:  Okay.

Peter Quill: Dude! How long have you been standing there?

Peter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?

Peter Quill: You're eating a zarg-nut.

Peter Quill: Mmm, no.

Peter Quill: This place looks deserted.

Peter Quill: Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.

Peter Quill: Drax. Drax.

Peter Quill: Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.

Peter Quill: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!

Peter Quill:  That was quick.

Peter Quill: Let her go, Grimace!

Peter Quill:  I told you to go right.

Peter Quill: You let her go!

Peter Quill: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.

Peter Quill: Or I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face!

Peter Quill:  I told you to go right.

Peter Quill: I love you, too.

Peter Quill: Stay down, clown.

Peter Quill: Everybody stay where you are. Chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?

Peter Quill:  Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

Peter Quill: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.

Peter Quill: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? "Jesus"?

Peter Quill: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

Peter Quill:  With Thanos? No, I'm here to kill Thanos. He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

Peter Quill: Oh.

Peter Quill: Yeah. Tall guy, not the good-looking, needed saving.

Peter Quill: The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.

Peter Quill: See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

Peter Quill: "Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

Peter Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good.

Peter Quill: It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.

Peter Quill:  Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?

Peter Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.

Peter Quill: How many did you see?

Peter Quill:  Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

Peter Quill: Boom!

Peter Quill:  I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?

Peter Quill: No, bullshit. Where is she?

Peter Quill: Good.

Peter Quill: ...What?

Peter Quill: Tell me she's lying.  ASSHOLE! TELL ME YOU DIDN'T DO IT!!!

Peter Quill:   No, you didn't… No, you didn't…   NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!

Peter Quill:

Peter Quill:  Where is he?!

Peter Quill:  Did we just lose?

Peter Quill: Aw, man.
