Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...  for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.

Ebony Maw: Let him have his fun.

Ebony Maw:  Shhh.

Ebony Maw:  My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.

Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...

Ebony Maw:  Stonekeeper... Does this chattering animal speak for you?

Ebony Maw: He exhausts me.

Ebony Maw: Bring me the Stone.

Ebony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.

Ebony Maw: Then I'll take it off your corpse.

Ebony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead.  NO!

Ebony Maw:  Zehobereians…

Ebony Maw: Choose a side, or die.

Ebony Maw: One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.

Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.

Ebony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. [the needles start to contact Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch[ Give me... the stone.

Ebony Maw: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...

Ebony Maw: ...could end your friend's life in an instant.

Ebony Maw:  You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
