Drax: We'll take his ship.

Drax: Wow.

Drax:: He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man.

Drax: It's true. You have gained a little weightâ€¦

Drax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

Drax: Including my own.

Drax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.

Drax: You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

Drax: That's a made up word.

Drax: An hour.

Drax: I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye. Watch.

Drax: But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.

Drax: I'm sure I'm invisible.

Drax: Damn it.

Drax: I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.

Drax: Today...

Drax: ...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

Drax: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.

Drax: Thanos!

Drax:  Thanos!

Drax:  Die, blanket of death!

Drax: I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?

Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.

Drax: I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

Drax: Yeah, that's right

Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?!

Drax: Quill!

Drax:  Quill...?
