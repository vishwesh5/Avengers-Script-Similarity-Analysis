Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!

Loki:  ALL RIGHT, STOP!

Loki:  I assure you, brother, the sun will shine on us again.

Loki: Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk.

Loki:  If I might interject… If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

Loki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard...  Odinson... The rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.

Loki:  You will... never be... a god.
