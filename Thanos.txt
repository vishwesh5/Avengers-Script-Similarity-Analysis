Thanos:  I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless.  It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I am.

Thanos:  The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.

Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

Thanos: That was a mistake.

Thanos: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

Thanos: If you consider failure experience.

Thanos: "Undying." You should choose your words more carefully.

Thanos:  No resurrections this time.

Thanos: What's wrong, little one?

Thanos:  What's your name?

Thanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Here. You try.

Thanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.

Thanos: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.

Thanos: I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

Thanos: I imagine it's like breathing for you.

Thanos: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.

Thanos: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?

Thanos: Why?  Why you? Daughter…

Thanos: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.

Thanos: That is, it was. Now… Reality can be whatever I want.

Thanos: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.

Thanos: Ah, the boyfriend.

Thanos: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it.  Do it!

Thanos: I like you.

Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.

Thanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.

Thanos: You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.

Thanos: I saved you.

Thanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.

Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.

Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.

Thanos: I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.

Thanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

Thanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did. And you lied.

Thanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

Thanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.

Thanos:  You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone?

Thanos: Show me.

Thanos: The stone had better be up there...For your sister's sake.

Thanos: You know us?

Thanos: Where's the Soul Stone?

Thanos: I am prepared.

Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?

Thanos: What's this?

Thanos: Tell me what it needs.

Thanos: Of what?

Thanos:

Thanos: I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.   I'm sorry, little one.

Thanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.

Thanos: And where do you think he brought you?

Thanos:  It was.  And it was beautiful.  Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

Thanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass.

Thanos: I'm a survivor.

Thanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that...mercy.

Thanos: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

Thanos: Our?

Thanos: Insect!

Thanos: Well, well.

Thanos: It would've been a waste of parts!

Thanos: My... Gamora...?

Thanos: I... had... to.

Thanos: You're full of tricks, wizard.

Thanos:  Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.  A fake.

Thanos: Stark.

Thanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

Thanos: Come on!

Thanos:   All that for a drop of blood.

Thanos: You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.  I hope they remember you.

Thanos: No tricks.

Thanos: One to go.

Thanos:  I understand, my child. Better than anyone.

Thanos:  Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now is no time at all.

Thanos:  You should've... You....  You should've gone for the head.

Thanos: Daughter?

Thanos: Yes.

Thanos:  ... Everything.
