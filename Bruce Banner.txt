Bruce Banner: Thanos is coming. He's coming...

Bruce Banner:  Hey, Tony.

Bruce Banner: Pepper.

Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York, that's him.

Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...

Bruce Banner: That's a thing?

Bruce Banner: Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.

Bruce Banner: What do you mean?

Bruce Banner: What? Tony, you lost another super bot?

Bruce Banner:  Call him.

Bruce Banner: No.

Bruce Banner: Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?

Bruce Banner: Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

Bruce Banner: Go! Got it!

Bruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?

Bruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.

Bruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.

Bruce Banner: I know.

Bruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't-

Bruce Banner: Damn it.

Bruce Banner: Where'd that come from?

Bruce Banner:  Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?

Bruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.

Bruce Banner:   Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me?  Come out! Come out! Come out!

Bruce Banner: What do you mean, "no"?!

Bruce Banner: Where you going?

Bruce Banner:  I'm gonna make a call.

Bruce Banner: Uh, I think you look great. Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.

Bruce Banner: Nat.

Bruce Banner: We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

Bruce Banner: Who's Scott?

Bruce Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's stone.

Bruce Banner: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.

Bruce Banner: I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.

Bruce Banner: Not me. Not here.

Bruce Banner:  Should we bow?

Bruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.

Bruce Banner: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

Bruce Banner:  Because, we didn't think of it.

Bruce Banner:  Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-  I'm okay. I'm okay.

Bruce Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision.

Bruce Banner: There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!

Bruce Banner:  AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!

Bruce Banner: I got him!

Bruce Banner: Ohh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-

Bruce Banner: Guys! Vision needs backup now!   Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.  Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

Bruce Banner: Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!  Come on!

Bruce Banner: See ya!  Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

Bruce Banner:  Cap. That's him.
