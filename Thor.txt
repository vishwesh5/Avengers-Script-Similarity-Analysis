Thor:  You talk too much.

Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.

Thor: You really are the worst brother.

Thor: NO!!!  You're going to die for that!

Thor: No… Loki…

Thor: Who the hell are you guys?

Thor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

Thor: Your father killed my brother.

Thor: Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.

Thor:  I need a hammer, not a spoon…  How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… Maybe a birth date or something…

Thor: Taking your pod.

Thor:  Are you mocking me?

Thor: Stop it. You did it again.

Thor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.

Thor: Knowhere.

Thor: Not anymore.

Thor: Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.

Thor: Or a genius.

Thor: There's six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.

Thor: They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

Thor: ...He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.

Thor: Wrong. Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.

Thor: All words are made up.

Thor: The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.

Thor: Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?

Thor: You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

Thor: Wonderful.

Thor: Quiet!

Thor: The Thanos killing kind.

Thor: No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.

Thor: A little bit. Yeah.

Thor: He already is.

Thor: So cool.

Thor: I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.

Thor:  Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.

Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

Thor: You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.

Thor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.

Thor: Both dead.

Thor: Killed by a dark elf.

Thor: Stabbed through the heart.

Thor:  Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.

Thor: Well, he's never fought me.

Thor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

Thor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?

Thor: What's this?

Thor: He gave you his eye?

Thor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.

Thor:  I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.

Thor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.

Thor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...

Thor: Yes. Why?

Thor:  Go back to the pod.

Thor: Eitri, wait! Stop!

Thor: What happened here?

Thor: Asgard is destroyed.   Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

Thor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer, sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

Thor: Did it have a name?

Thor: So how do we make it?

Thor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.

Thor: Leave that to me.

Thor:  More... power... rabbit!

Thor: That's Nivadellir!

Thor: What?

Thor: How long will it take to heat?

Thor:  I'm gonna hold it open.

Thor: So is facing Thanos without that axe.

Thor: Allfathers, give me strength.

Thor: Only if I die.

Thor: BRING ME THANOS!!!

Thor:  Notice you've copied my beard.

Thor: By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

Thor:  I told you. You'd die for that!

Thor: NO!

Thor: What'd you do?  WHAT'D YOU DO?!
