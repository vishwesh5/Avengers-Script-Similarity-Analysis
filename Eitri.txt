Eitri: Thor?

Eitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!

Eitri:  300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. "Your life is yours." he said "But your hands are mine alone."

Eitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

Eitri: Stormbreaker.

Eitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.

Eitri: Well done, boy.

Eitri: Damn it.

Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.

Eitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.

Eitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

Eitri: That's suicide.

Eitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.

Eitri:  Yes. That's what... "killing you" means.

Eitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

Eitri: He needs the axe! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!
