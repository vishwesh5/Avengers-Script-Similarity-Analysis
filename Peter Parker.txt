Peter Parker:  Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

Peter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

Peter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.

Peter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

Peter Parker: On it!

Peter Parker:  Not cool!

Peter Parker: Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!

Peter Parker: But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!

Peter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.

Peter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

Peter Parker: Oh, come on!

Peter Parker: Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus.

Peter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

Peter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.

Peter Parker: I was gonna go home-

Peter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-

Peter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

Peter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.

Peter Parker: No. I did think this through.

Peter Parker: It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.

Peter Parker: Um. Okay, okay...uh....  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

Peter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those!

Peter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.

Peter Parker:  I'm backup.

Peter Parker: No. I'm Peter, by the way.

Peter Parker: Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.

Peter Parker:  Hey, what's going on?

Peter Parker: Yep, got it.

Peter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.

Peter Parker: We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!

Peter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I end up eating you, I'm sorry.

Peter Parker: I'm trying to say that something is coming.

Peter Parker:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!

Peter Parker:  So, you're not with Thanos?

Peter Parker: We're the Avengers, man.

Peter Parker: Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

Peter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?

Peter Parker: It never was.

Peter Parker: Okay.

Peter Parker: Hey, what was that?

Peter Parker: Magic!  More magic!  Magic with a kick!  Magic with a-

Peter Parker: It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!  I got it! I got it...!

Peter Parker:  Oh, God.

Peter Parker:  I got you! I got you!  I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names!

Peter Parker:  Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...

Peter Parker:  I don't know what's- I don't know what's happening. I don't-  Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry.
